# Web Games Collection by Leni Wen

Welcome to my repository, where I am building a collection of classic web games. The goal is not only to provide entertaining games but also to explore and demonstrate various programming concepts and practices.

## Game Included

### 2048

2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine then and create a tile with the number 2048. However, you can keep playing to achieve higher scores.

#### Feature:

- Smooth Sliding Animations: Enjoy seamless tile movement as you play.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of your current score and your highest score.
- Game Over Detection: Automatically detects when no further moves are possible.
- Undo: Ability to undo the last move.
- Colorful interface: Each tile has a distinct color that changes as you combine them, making the game visually appealing.

#### TODO:

- [ ] Playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Minesweeper(In Development)

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game. The player's goal is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with the help of clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

#### TODO:

- [ ] Design and implement the game board.
- [ ] Generate mines and calculate numbers for each cell.
- [ ] Implement game logic for left-click and right-click.
- [ ] Create a timer to track how long it takes to clear the board.
- [ ] Add difficulty levels(Easy, Medium, Hard).
